# Artificial-Neural-Network-from-Scratch

A Neural network is a type of bio-inspired machine learning model based loosely on a brain. First developed in 1957 by two MIT researchers, it has grown to become one of the most widely used technologies to date. Many companies have made APIs/libraries to make it easier for others to use, simplifying the training process and building process of the model. Tensorflow by Google and Pytorch by Facebook are the most popular deep learning APIs/libraries out on the market today, with Caffe starting to become popular.

However, because these APIs/libraries simplify the deep learning process, you dont get to see what happens in the 'blackbox'. This code details how a artifical neurel network is built, trained and used to predict new data. This is done through unpresidented visuals using matplotlib plotting and live animations.
